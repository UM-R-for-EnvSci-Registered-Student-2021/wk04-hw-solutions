# Week 04 - Homework <br/> Coercion and data creation, loading, and saving

Welcome to your assignment for **week 4**. As usual, **Clone** this repo into your own :computer:  using RStudio, as we saw in class.

Your mission for this week, should you choose to accept it, is:

1. **Clone** this repo into your own :computer:  using RStudio, as we saw in class.
2. Open the **R script** file called "01_wk04_homework", located in the "R" folder, and follow the instructions in the comments
3. Once you are done with the R script files, save the changes, make sure scripts are properly saved in te **R** folder.
4. Commit all the changes to the *repo/R project* (remember to write a commit mesage!)
5. **Push** all changes back to **GitHub**
6. Go to GitHub and check that it all worked out

As always, feel free to use [the Issues](https://github.com/UM-R-for-EnvSci-Registered-Student-2021/General-Discussion/issues) section of the of [General Discussion](https://github.com/UM-R-for-EnvSci-Registered-Student-2021/General-Discussion) repo to ask any questions you might have or to share anny issues you come across. 

Note for those of you **still waiting for a final Git/GitHub set up**. You can still use the green button labelled "code" to download a zip version of the repository. You can unzip this anywhere in your computer and open the R project by double clicking the blue cube .RProj file. then you will be able to work on the project, edit and save like you would on any other R project.The only difference, for now, is that you will not be able to "push" the changes back to github, as that folder is not being tracked by Git/GitHub. We will need to find a separate solution for you to get this folder back to me once you are done with the asignment (e.g. zip eail attachment or dropbox/google drive/onedrive link)

*Happy coding!*
